    "## Analysis:\n",
    "The conversation between two chat agents is difficult to continue because both chat agents askes very specific questions and none of them has the ability to answer those questions. Based on the previous output, we can see that when Chen's chat agent is asking my chat agent about its favorite music genre, my chat agent cannot reply and thus tries to switch to another topic. Similarly, when my chat agent asked Chen Agent's gender, Chen's agent could not answer the question either."

    "## Challenges\n",
    "1. Because some functions in my class agent askes for additional inputs in order to get the answer, it is hard to maintain a durable conversation between Chen's chat agent and mines by alternatively calling the **respondTo()** function.\n",
    "2. Enable the chat agent to respond to various questions is also helpful to maintain a durable conversation, which is also challenging to implement."
