The output above shows the number of generations produced by royal road with intermediate schma in order to find the optimal answer, with **population size 128**, **individual size 64**, **crossover rate 0.7**, and **mutation rate 0.005**. The average value of five tests is **847.8**, which is higher than **590**, the average value of normal RR in Melanie Mitchell's Royal Roads paper. However, **590** is the average of 50 runs, and **883.2** is the result of only 5 runs. The range of those runs is surprisingly large, which may mostly influenced by the quality (the fitness value) initial seeds.\n",
